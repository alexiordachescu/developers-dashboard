Developers Dashboard is a platform for developers to store code snippets and links to essential resources. This project was realized in 5 days by a group of 3 Codaisseur students. There weren't any hard requirements for this project, the only guideline we've received was related to the generic theme: useful things we would've liked to have during the Codaisseur bootcamp.
